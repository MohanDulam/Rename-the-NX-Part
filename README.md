It difficult Rename the part name in Assembly file of Siemens NX directly without disturbing the Assembly references. 

I developed a code to Rename part name in assembly.

This code mainly used “ug_edit_part_names.exe” application. I added GUI to this application.

We can use this “ug_edit_part_names.exe” application in “NX Command prompt” like below image. The location of this file is “C:\Program Files\Siemens\NX 12.0\NXBIN\ ug_edit_part_names.exe”.
