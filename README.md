This Code is inspired from this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pex-1GbgwTs)

In video description they provided the source code also in python. Link here(https://github.com/nahidmubin/Siemens_NX_File_Renaming)
I simply rewrote the C# code. I encountered a few difficulties understanding the code along the process, but with the use of AI tools, I was able to resolve them.

In this code mainly used “ug_edit_part_names.exe” application. I added GUI to this application.

We can this “ug_edit_part_names.exe” application in “NX Command prompt” like below image. The location of this file is “C:\Program Files\Siemens\NX 12.0\NXBIN\ ug_edit_part_names.exe”.
